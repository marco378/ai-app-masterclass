## **Part 1: AI Prompt Engineering Basics (8 minutes)**

### What is Prompt Engineering?
Think of AI like a super-smart assistant who needs clear instructions. Prompt engineering is simply learning how to give better instructions.

### üî• **The Magic Formula for Great Prompts**

```
CONTEXT + TASK + FORMAT + EXAMPLES = Perfect Prompt
```

#### ‚ùå **Bad Prompt:**
"Make me a website"

#### ‚úÖ **Good Prompt:**
"I need a personal portfolio website for a graphic designer. Create an HTML page with:
- Header with name and navigation
- About section with bio
- Portfolio gallery showing 6 projects
- Contact form with email/phone
- Use modern, clean design with blue and white colors
- Make it mobile-friendly"

### **Quick Practice Exercise (2 minutes)**
Let students turn this bad prompt into a good one:
- Bad: "Create an app"
- Have them add: What kind? For who? What features? How should it look?

## **Part 2: Building Our App with AI (15 minutes)**

### **Project: Personal Task Manager**
We'll build a simple but powerful task management app that works on any device.

### **Step 1: Planning Our App (2 minutes)**
What do we need?
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Save tasks (so they don't disappear)
- Nice, friendly design

### **Step 2: The Perfect Prompt for Our App (3 minutes)**

Here's the exact prompt we'll use with AI:

```markdown
Create a personal task manager web application with these requirements:

FUNCTIONALITY:
- Add new tasks with a text input and "Add" button
- Display all tasks in a clean list
- Each task has a checkbox to mark complete/incomplete
- Delete button (üóëÔ∏è) for each task
- Tasks persist when page refreshes (use localStorage)
- Show task count (e.g., "3 tasks remaining")

DESIGN:
- Modern, friendly interface
- Use a pleasant color scheme (blues and greens)
- Responsive design that works on mobile
- Clean typography and spacing
- Completed tasks should appear crossed out
- Add subtle animations for interactions

TECHNICAL:
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- No external dependencies
- Works in all modern browsers
- Clean, commented code

EXTRAS:
- Welcome message for first-time users
- Empty state message when no tasks
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
```

### **Step 3: Getting the Code from AI (5 minutes)**

**Demonstrate:**
1. Open ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI assistant
2. Paste the prompt
3. Show the generated code
4. Explain key parts:
   - HTML structure (what users see)
   - CSS styling (how it looks)
   - JavaScript functionality (how it works)

### **Step 4: Understanding the Code (5 minutes)**

**Break down the main parts:**
- `<input>` - where users type tasks
- `<button>` - to add tasks
- `<ul>` - list to show all tasks
- `localStorage` - saves tasks in browser
- Event listeners - make buttons work
